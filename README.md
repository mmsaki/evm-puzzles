## How to play

Clone this repository and install its dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn`). Then run:

```
npx hardhat play
```

In some puzzles you only need to provide the value that will be sent to the contract, in others the calldata, and in others both values.

You can use [`evm.codes`](https://www.evm.codes/)'s reference and playground to work through this.
